# Overview
Build pipeline for the Phenoscape Knowledgebase


## Aims
Current version of the [pipeline](https://github.com/phenoscape/phenoscape-owl-tools/tree/master/pipeline) to be replaced with a newer version built in accordance with the following aims:

* Modularize the pipeline
* Institute quality control measures
* Use generic (commoditized) tools ([robot](http://robot.obolibrary.org/), [dosdp](https://github.com/INCATools/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns), etal)

## Projects

### Pipeline Refactoring
1. Loading and reasoning core Phenoscape data
2. Auto-generating axioms

4. Semantic similarity

### Quality Control Automation
* Create automated test suite for all the parts of the pipeline
* Formal and machine-testable definitions of OWL/RDF model expectations
    * ShEx
    * SHACL
    * SPARQL Queries
